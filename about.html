           <div class="item">
             <p>I have experience in a few coding languages so far such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C++. Currently, I am learning to code with the Thinkful program but have a bit of experience with coding by teaching myself and am always looking to expand my knowledge on coding languages.</p>
             <p>I love working in team settings getting ideas from everyone to make a collective project and have communication for help whenever needed.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="item">
             <p>my interests outside of coding are working on my small hobbies such as playing guitar and playing video games. I love to also go hiking in my free time and take nature shots of what I find interesting.</p>
             <p>I would provide any client with a well-finished product in their image and make them happy with the finished product. I can provide skills in HTML, Javascript, CSS, and C++.</p>
